Change 'marker-list-function' has issues
笨・[ERROR] marker-list/spec.md: Delta sections ## ADDED Requirements were found, but no requirement entries parsed. Ensure each section includes at least one "### Requirement:" block (REMOVED may use bullet list syntax).
笨・[ERROR] file: Change must have at least one delta. No deltas found. Ensure your change has a specs/ directory with capability folders (e.g. specs/http-server/spec.md) containing .md files that use delta headers (## ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements) and that each requirement includes at least one "#### Scenario:" block. Tip: run "openspec change show <change-id> --json --deltas-only" to inspect parsed deltas.
Next steps:
  - Ensure change has deltas in specs/: use headers ## ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements
  - Each requirement MUST include at least one #### Scenario: block
  - Debug parsed deltas: openspec change show <id> --json --deltas-only
